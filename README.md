User Information Card is a simple web application that allows users to input and display their name, phone number, village, and city. The user data is stored locally using the Local Storage API. This project aims for UI consistency, efficient local storage use, and provides creative features like a theme selector.

## Usage
Upon opening the application, it will check if user data is available in local storage. If data exists, it will display the user information; otherwise, it will ask for input.

Fill in the form with your name, phone number, village, and city, and click the "Save" button.

The entered user information will be stored in local storage, and the UI will be updated to display the data in real-time.

You can use the theme selector to switch between different themes or color schemes, including light and dark modes.

When you refresh the page or return to the application, your stored user data will be displayed, and you can change it if needed.

## Technologies Used
HTML: For creating the structure of the web page.

CSS: For styling and theming.

JavaScript: For capturing user input, local storage interaction, and dynamic UI updates.
